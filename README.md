# isComputerOn-Python
 Python library for cheking if the computer is on.

 Finally, a long awaited and sorely needed Python library for checking if the machine running the code is turned on and functioning!

 Simply call the function and, if it returns True, the machine is on. Very useful for stuff... Must have include in every code, as no code will run if the computer is not on! So, save yourself the embarassment and check for it!

 The function simply returns True if the computer is on. The return of the function is undefined for such cases where computer is not on. The code with an example use is given.

 The library was extensively tested under Linux and Windows.


 #IMPORTANT NOTE:

 This is a joke based on this NPM package: https://www.npmjs.com/package/is-computer-on I found after the following thread was posted by u/ooqq on r/programminghorror subreddit: https://www.reddit.com/r/programminghorror/comments/icop4g/i_was_just_following_a_tutorial_i_swear/
